## Rackmount 3-Band Parametric EQ and Compression FX unit

### [SCHEMATIC](https://github.com/JordanAceto/wiggly_EQ/blob/main/construction_docs/wiggly_EQ_schematic.pdf)

### Features:
#### 3 bands of Parametric EQ
- boost/cut control
- Q control
- Center frequency control
- Voltage controlled frequency for wiggly and swooshy modulation effects

#### Compression
- Nice THAT compressor
- Ratio control
- Threshold control
- Makeup gain

#### LFO
- Wiggles the EQ stages
- Also does amplitude modulation for tremolo

#### Expression pedal input
- Works as a Volume pedal
- Can also control the LFO rate

#### LED bar graph meter
- Can indicate compression gain reduction
- Can also indicate the audio level at -10dBv or +4dBu

### Notes:
- this is an old project that I built on pad-per-hole prototyping board. There is no PCB layout.
- I would probably do a few things differently today, but it does work well and sounds good.
- there are a few missing values, and some that I had to guess about, it's probably pretty close to right, but there might be some errors.
- there is a map of the protoboard IC locations as a troubleshooting and modification aid
